### Purpose of the Project

This research project is dedicated to understanding the sentiments and perspectives of the Swiss population on the country’s energy transition. Using advanced sentiment analysis techniques and large language models (LLMs), the study aims to analyze public opinion as expressed through various media channels, social platforms, and publications. The results from this project will support better-informed policies and strategies that align with the population's attitudes and preferences, facilitating a smoother transition toward sustainable energy solutions in Switzerland.

The project leverages expertise in energy systems analysis and optimization to interpret and contextualize sentiment data in the broader framework of Switzerland's energy goals. By connecting public sentiment with technical and policy-oriented insights, the research seeks to provide a comprehensive view of the societal and operational factors influencing the energy transition.
