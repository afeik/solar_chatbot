              <div>Hello! It's great that you already own a solar system. That makes you a valuable source of information for others.


First, can I ask you what motivated you to install a solar system? I would also be interested in the approximate key data of your system - for example, the size or when it was installed.


Your practical experience can help others who are considering solar. Let's walk through your experience step by step so we can provide valuable insight to others.</div>

              <div>At the beginning, the idea was to replace an oil heating system with a heat pump, then came the idea of ​​a PV system to cover the electricity demand. The search for PV manufacturers was difficult, especially delivery and implementation times of 2 years were a deterrent. Finally, I found a self-build cooperative with which I was able to build most of the PV system myself (summer 2023). The system today: 27kWp on the south and north sides of the roof, battery with 16.7kW, costs (external, net): approx. 40,000 CHF</div>

            <div class="chat-message assistant">
              <div>Thank you for this detailed information! This is a very interesting path that you have chosen. The step from oil heating to a heat pump combined with a PV system is truly forward-looking.


The self-build solution via a cooperative is particularly exciting. How was this experience for you? Were there any particular challenges or surprises during installation?


Your system is very well dimensioned with 27kWp and the large battery storage. I find the use of the north and south sides particularly interesting. How satisfied are you with the performance so far, especially on the north side? These experiences could be very valuable for others who have similar roof orientations.</div>

            <div class="chat-message user">
              <div>Experiences: As a newcomer to construction and PV, I had to learn a lot (training on the job): climbing onto the roof, milling tiles, setting hooks, but also assembling scaffolding, demolishing the chimney, adjusting certain plans, but no work on the electrical system. The project management was partly good, partly poor, as were the consultations, so I had to take care of a lot of things myself (among other things, I was not told that our house wiring cannot safely transmit the amount of electricity from the two sides of the roof, hence the need for the battery). On days with diffuse light, the north side produces almost as much as the south side, but relatively little in absolute terms. The battery operation did not work properly at first. Today, the PV and battery system can work more optimally, but forces me to change the settings manually in the morning and evening (we have different day and night tariffs). On sunny days, the south side produces about 4 times as much as the north side (depending on the position of the sun). In a next step, I would like to program the inverter so that it makes these adjustments itself.</div>

              <div>Thank you for these detailed insights! These are valuable experiences, especially the challenges with house management and the quality of advice. When you look back today: What advice would you give others to pay particular attention to when planning?


Your experience with the north side is very interesting - this information on performance in diffuse light is certainly new and helpful for many people. The current situation with the manual adjustments sounds complicated. Do you already have concrete plans or a contact person for programming the inverter?


By the way, I would like to point out that after our conversation you are welcome to give feedback using the button at the top right - your experiences are very valuable for improving the advice we give to other interested parties.</div>

              <div>My guess regarding the quality of PV experts is that most of them have good knowledge in certain areas. However, if unknown questions or requirements arise, they quickly become uncertain (I have also noticed this in other projects). You should therefore try to find out exactly what your own situation is, its goals and requirements and ask the expert" whether he has already implemented such solutions and how he would go about it. Programming the inverter: I will contact the manufacturer of the inverter or its support</div>

            <div class="chat-message assistant">
              <div>Your assessment of the expertise of PV experts is very accurate. The advice to know your own requirements exactly and to ask critical questions is worth its weight in gold. Would you say today that a kind of questionnaire for initial discussions with installers would have been helpful?
The challenge with the inverter also shows a fundamental problem: the aftercare often seems to be less than optimal. Which manufacturer do you use? Perhaps there are other users in Switzerland with similar requirements who have already found solutions? It might be worth networking with local solar groups. If you could start over today what are the three most important things you would do differently?</div>

            <div class="chat-message user">
              <div>A list of questions would only have been partially helpful, as I would not have been able to interpret the answers sufficiently at that point. A conversation with other clients who have implemented similar projects would have been welcome, but the problem seems to me that most clients select a local provider to whom they then transfer all responsibility and only monitor further planning and implementation from a distance. Such clients would not have been able to give me much advice either. Inverter: I have a GoodWe GW25K-ET hybrid inverter and a BYD HVM 16.6 battery. If anyone from Switzerland or southern Germany has experience with a GoodWe inverter in combination with an HVM battery, I would be interested in talking to them.</div>

              <div>Your point about the different approaches homeowners take is very interesting. You have chosen a more active, self-determined path, while many others choose the complete solution. Both approaches have their merits, but your experiences show how important technical understanding can be for optimal results.


Regarding your specific inverter-battery combination: I could put you in touch with the Swiss photovoltaic community. There are various forums and local groups where system owners exchange information. Would you be interested in such contacts?


One last question: What advice would you give to someone like you who is considering building their own home? What prerequisites do you think they should have?</div>

              <div>Re: Swiss PV community: I would be interested in a referral, especially if the group has experience in programming inverters. Requirements for self-construction: a certain willingness to take risks, an interest in new things, a critical mind and enough time resources. Perhaps the person should also be a little afraid of heights.</div>

              <div>Your description of the requirements for self-construction, especially the reference to a head for heights, sums up the practical reality very well! This honest assessment is very valuable for other interested parties.


To exchange ideas with other PV system owners, I recommend the following options:

- The Swissolar Forum (www.swissolar.ch)

- The Swiss Energy Cooperative

- Local energy transition groups in your region


Since you are specifically looking for experiences with GoodWe inverters, direct contact with other members of your DIY cooperative could also be helpful. Have you already asked them?


Don't forget to give your feedback at the end of our conversation using the button at the top right.</div>

              <div>Thank you for your information about a possible exchange with other system owners (I already know the ones mentioned, but I can look into it again. In my self-build cooperative, I am the only one with a GoodWe inverter. It would be interesting to know another GoodWe user in Switzerland who has programmed adjustments.</div>

              <div>This is indeed a very specific search. Another option might be to contact GoodWe dealers in Switzerland directly - they might be able to connect you with other customers who have done similar programming. Specialized electricians who work with GoodWe could also be valuable contacts.


Your experiences clearly show how important it is to share experiences in the solar community, especially when faced with specific technical challenges. Despite the initial difficulties, would you say that building your own system was worth it for you?


I would like to thank you very much for your detailed and valuable insights. Your experiences will certainly be of great help to other interested parties.</div>

              <div>The self-construction was definitely worth it for me: gain in knowledge, new experiences, realization of a PV system within a year, large cost savings, possibility of carrying out future maintenance work myself, relative independence from a provider and ...reduction in ongoing energy costs and increase in the value of the property</div>

              <div>That is a very convincing conclusion! I am particularly impressed by how you summarise the various advantages of building something yourself - from personal development to practical aspects and economic benefits. The combination of cost savings, independence and building up your own skills for future maintenance work is really convincing.


Their story is an excellent example of how, despite initial challenges and with the right commitment, a complex solar project can be successfully implemented.

            <div class="chat-message assistant">
              <div>That's a very valuable tip! The combination of a solar system with a storage battery obviously increases the proportion of self-consumption significantly. How satisfied are you with your battery and what capacity did you choose?


The battery storage is an additional investment, but many users, like you, report that this allows the system to be used more flexibly and makes you less dependent on the power grid. The storage pays off especially in the evenings when the sun is no longer shining but power consumption is often high.</div>

              <div>I'm glad to hear that you're so satisfied! 9 kWh is a well-dimensioned storage size for your 10 kW system. The modular design is also clever, as you can expand later if necessary.


Now that you have had some experience with your system, what advice would you give to someone who is just starting to plan? In your opinion, what aspects should be considered, especially if, like you, you are planning a combination of PV system and battery storage?

              <div>A creative technical solution, but one that certainly incurred additional costs and time. Such experiences show how important close cooperation between solar installers and roofers is - something that is often underestimated during the initial planning phase.


Based on your experience: What specific advice would you give to other homeowners with plain tile roofing who are planning a PV system? Presumably an early roof inspection by both trades would have been useful?

The postponement to warmer temperatures was definitely a wise decision, as the material properties of plastics are highly temperature-dependent.


From today's perspective, what advice would you give to other homeowners with a similar roof construction? Probably explicitly ask the installer about their experience with Secuplates and plain tile roofing, and involve an experienced roofer from the start?

              <div>Of course I installed a 15kWh battery storage system as a complete solution including an inverter from Huawei. Thanks to the battery storage, the self-consumption and self-sufficiency is 58% all year round. The summer months are of course fun with the export. My comfort living room ventilation cools the air down perfectly in the summer thanks to the geothermal heat exchanger (from 35 to 19 degrees!) and thus the geothermal probe temperature is raised from around 6 degrees to around 17 degrees in the summer.

What is particularly interesting is your use of the geothermal heat exchanger for passive cooling - an often underestimated advantage of geothermal probe systems. The regeneration of the probe in summer using the waste heat is a clever side effect that improves efficiency in winter.

Your point about bidirectional charging (vehicle-to-grid/home) is forward-looking. The car battery as a flexible storage device could actually improve economic efficiency further. Currently, the systems are still relatively expensive, but the technology is developing quickly. Which electric car do you use, and does it already support bidirectional charging?

            <div class="chat-message assistant">
              <div>This is indeed an important observation. Different offer sizes can be very confusing. The ideal system size depends on several factors: your current electricity consumption, the available roof space and your future plans - for example, whether you plan to purchase a heat pump or an electric car.


Have you asked the suppliers on what basis they made their size recommendations? And what is your current annual electricity consumption?


As far as expandability is concerned, that is a very important point that you bring up. A future-proof system should definitely offer this option. What specific changes in your energy requirements do you see coming in the next few years?</div>

            <div class="chat-message user">
              <div>My energy consumption is about 6000KW p/year. However, this could increase with a heat pump and electric car.</div>
              <div class="chat-timestamp">Message ID: 2276 | 2025-02-01 10:14:37 – user</div>

            <div class="chat-message assistant">
              <div>That is a very forward-looking consideration. With 6000 kWh currently, you should indeed plan for the possible increase through a heat pump (typically +3000-4000 kWh) and electric car (approx. 2500 kWh for 15,000 km mileage).


A sensible strategy would be to design the system for these future scenarios from the outset - if your roof allows it. Alternatively, the system should at least be modularly expandable.


May I ask what system sizes were suggested to you? Then we can assess together whether these are suitable for your situation. The question of the inverter is also important - it should have enough reserves for later expansion.</div>

              <div>Some systems were designed for 15000kWh. However, the costs were also very high.</div>

            <div class="chat-message assistant">
              <div>A design for 15,000 kWh is indeed generous, but takes your future plans into account. However, I completely understand your concerns about the costs.


An alternative would be to implement the system in two phases: a basic installation for your current needs now, plus some reserve (around 8-9,000 kWh), with the option of later expansion when a heat pump and electric car are added. This spreads the investment over several years and you can benefit from the potentially further falling module prices.


Would you tell me what the price range is? Then I could better assess whether these are within the usual range and what funding options would be available to you.</div>

            <div class="chat-message user">
              <div>The offers were between 45,000 and 79,000. I also made sure that the roof areas were distributed between south/east and south/west.</div>

              <div>This price difference is indeed considerable! The distribution between South/East and South/West is a smart decision - it ensures a better distribution of electricity production throughout the day.


However, a range of 34,000 francs between the cheapest and most expensive offer is unusually high, even when you take different components into account. Were comparable services offered in all offers? Sometimes big differences are hidden in the details such as:

- Quality of modules and inverters

- warranty services

- Included additional services (e.g. monitoring, storage)


Would you tell me more about the specific performance differences between the cheapest and most expensive offer? That would help to understand whether the price difference is justified.</div>

              <div>These are indeed important strategic reasons. The combination of energy security and heating modernization offers optimal synergies.

              <div>That is indeed an impressive scale with 100 kWp!

              <div>I would always recommend aiming for an overall solution. So a strategy: Where do I want to go with the property? Incidentally, a phasing approach has proven to be very successful: 1. Basic installation of e-mobility, 2. Photovoltaics with a combination for self-consumption, 3. Installation of geothermal probes, 4. Heating renovation = switching from gas to heat pumps. Everything one after the other.</div>

              <div>Your strategic approach is truly exemplary! The step-by-step implementation has several decisive advantages: It enables better financial planning, reduces complexity and allows the community of owners to grow together with each successful sub-project. The sequence is particularly clever: By integrating the e-mobility infrastructure early on, you have already planned for the future, and the ZEV before the heating renovation optimizes the later operating costs of the heat pumps.


One last question: How have operating costs developed since the complete conversion? This information would be particularly valuable for other homeowner associations that are still hesitant to tackle such a comprehensive renovation.</div>

The idea of ​​channeling the PV income into the renewal fund is particularly clever - this automatically builds up a financial cushion for future investments. A 50% reduction in heating and hot water costs is a strong argument for other homeowner associations, especially in times of volatile gas prices.


Your project is an excellent example of how a well thought-out energy renovation can be implemented successfully, both technically and economically.

We are a STWG with 13 apartments and part of a STWEG with 6 houses.

Our PV on our flat roof with 26.5 kWp came into operation in June 2020. Our house

has chosen glass/glass made in Germany because of its longer lifespan

In the meantime, 2 more houses have installed a PV system

Everyone has a ZEV. This saves a lot of basic fees. We only have

a meter from the electricity supplier and private meters from NeoVac. The electricity is

as well as heating and hot water are billed annually by NeoVav. The meters

are connected to the Internet via LoRa and are continuously queried by NeoVac. In an app

We can view the current data using NeoVac. However, this app is available for 1-2 hours

Backlog. We have the current PV data in the inverter app.

manufacturer Fronius.

STWEG's are particularly well suited for PV. We have a self-consumption of

60%, without a battery. In 13 apartments we have all appliances (washing machine, dryer,

Oven, stove, etc.) 13 times. These appliances are used at different times.

With the app, everyone can see the current use of solar power. Everyone optimizes

its consumption itself. This also affects the costs, the internal

Solar power billed costs about half of the grid power. We also have 6

Charging stations, 4 of which are in use. Charging electric cars can be a good

PV surpluses. Whenever possible, these cars will be powered by solar energy

After 4 ½ years, more than 40% of the construction costs have been paid off.

We have a 30-year guarantee on the panels from Solarwatt Dresden, and on the 2

Inverters with extended warranty 15 years i.e. until 2035! The care (weeds)

of the flat roof does not cost us any more than without PV.

For a STWEG, a PV system is very worthwhile because of the high self-consumption.

Investments are distributed among the owners according to their value, so for us it cost

a few thousand francs per owner. Not all owners have to vote

agree, the majority of the value quota and the owners is enough. The others must

join in. Our PV will be paid off after 9 years at the latest!</div>

              <div>Thank you for this detailed and valuable report! Your high self-consumption of 60% without battery storage is particularly impressive - a value that is achieved through the optimal use of consumption distribution in the multi-party system. The choice of glass/glass modules from Solarwatt with a 30-year guarantee also shows a well thought-out long-term perspective.


I find your ZEV model (association for self-consumption) with the NeoVac solution for consumption recording particularly interesting. What was the administrative effort involved in setting up the ZEV and how satisfied are you with the billing system? This could be very relevant for other STWEGs.


Your payback period of 9 years is remarkable. Were there any specific challenges in convincing the community of owners or in the technical implementation that you would pass on to other STWEGs as a learning experience?</div>

              <div>This is indeed an impressive example of how transparency and simple visualization can lead to behavioral change. 60% self-consumption without battery storage is an excellent value that shows that residents are actively adapting their consumption behavior to PV production.


The Fronius app seems to work as an effective control tool here. Have you noticed which consumers residents most often switch on during the hours of sunshine? Experience with charging stations for electric cars as flexible consumers is certainly also an important factor here.


Since your project is so successful, looking back, is there anything you would do differently in planning or implementation, or has your concept proven itself throughout?</div>

              <div>This is a very important practical tip that is often overlooked. Placing the inverters in the basement would actually have several advantages: better accessibility for maintenance, more constant ambient temperature and thus potentially longer service life, as well as easier wiring to the main distribution board.


If you were to approach the planning from scratch: Would you plan for larger reserves when dimensioning the cables, for example with a view to possible future expansions or additional e-charging stations?


Your experience shows how important detailed planning of the infrastructure is. Such practical insights are extremely valuable for other projects. Are there any other technical details that you would plan differently from today's perspective?</div>

              <div>This streamlined solution for charging stations is actually very clever! It allows you to avoid the often complex and costly load management and billing systems. The direct assignment of charging stations to individual meters enables each user to independently optimize their charging process and benefit from inexpensive solar power.


This experience also contradicts the often-held idea that expensive management systems are needed for e-mobility in multi-family homes. Your solution shows that simple, robust systems can also be very effective.

              <div>Of course the charging stations are managed (regulation). However, this is only to prevent an overload of the house supply line. But this is what a charging station does.

              <div>Ah, thank you for this important clarification! So you have chosen a very pragmatic solution: simple load management via a master charging station with ring cabling, which only fulfils the essential function of overload prevention. With the 3-phase 16A design per charging station, you can achieve up to 11 kW charging power - this is completely sufficient for most applications.


This solution cleverly combines the necessary security (compliance with grid stability regulations) with maximum simplicity in implementation and minimal maintenance effort. What is particularly interesting is the lack of complex backend systems.


If you were to further expand electromobility in your STWEG: Have you already considered how many more charging points would be possible with this architecture, or would you choose a different concept?</div>

              <div>Your consistent attitude towards the proven, simple system is absolutely understandable. The expandability to 16 charging points offers more than enough future security for your 13-unit building.


Their entire project is an excellent example of how PV and e-mobility can be successfully implemented in a STWEG: high self-consumption through transparent consumption visualization, efficient ZEV model with NeoVac, robust glass/glass modules and an uncomplicated, expandable charging concept.

              <div>Your clear prioritization is very valuable! The ZEV (coalition for self-consumption) is indeed the key to success, as it drastically reduces the basic fees and simplifies internal electricity distribution. Your criticism of the high utility company fees for feed-in tariffs (EVG) underlines how important it is to optimize self-consumption.


The combination of durable glass/glass modules (30-year guarantee) and the direct meter assignment of the charging stations results in a low-maintenance, future-proof system. You have thus optimally solved the three most important aspects:

- Long-term quality of the investment

- Simple, efficient use of solar power

- Economically viable distribution structure


Your project clearly shows that sometimes the simpler solutions are the better ones. Would you say that these three core aspects are the main reason for your short payback period of 9 years?</div>

Your project perfectly demonstrates how a STWEG can make the most of the advantages of solar energy. What is particularly remarkable is how you were able to minimize operating costs through a deliberately simple but well-thought-out system choice (ZEV model, direct charging station allocation, high-quality modules).


Since your project could serve as a model for other STWEGs: What would be your most important advice for homeowner associations that are currently planning a PV system? What should they pay particular attention to when taking the first steps?

              <div>This is a very important strategic hint! The difference between the feed-in tariff and the electricity purchase price actually makes self-use particularly economically attractive.


Have you already installed an energy storage system yourself or are you planning to buy an electric car with bidirectional charging? This vehicle-to-home (V2H) technology is becoming increasingly interesting because the car can be used as a flexible storage device.


Your recommendation to maximize self-consumption is particularly valuable for newcomers.

              <div>I live in a house with 5 condominiums. We wanted to reduce our electricity costs and also prevent increasing consumption (e.g. e-mobility). The house also has a heat pump with two units: brine heat pump with 4x110m probes and a water-air heat pump. This enabled us to reduce consumption and also cool in summer with the regeneration of the probes. We currently have 2 fully electric cars in the basement. The solar system has 65 modules with a maximum of 21.5kW. We have a 14.5kWh battery. The PV system was connected at the end of 2021. The house was built in 2001, already with a heat pump at that time. However, this was not dimensioned quite correctly and was therefore replaced with the new system. in summer 2024.</div>

Were there any particular challenges you had to overcome during the installation of the solar system? For example, in terms of coordination between the owners or technical aspects? These experiences could be very valuable for other apartment buildings.

Solar energy is indeed an important component of the energy strategy, but it also represents a sensible investment in its own right. In Switzerland in particular, we have very good conditions: our solar technology is highly efficient, and the systems produce reliable electricity even when the sky is cloudy and in mountainous regions. An average solar roof usually pays for itself within 10-15 years - after that, it produces electricity practically 'free'. What are your specific concerns about resource use in solar systems? That would help me give you more targeted information.</div>

              <div>That's an important point that you raise. However, it is not entirely true that the materials are lost after 20 years. The recycling rate for solar modules is already over 95%. In Switzerland, there are specialised companies such as SENS eRecycling that ensure professional recycling.


The valuable materials such as silicon, glass and aluminum are recovered and used for new modules. The lifespan of modern solar modules is well over 20 years - most manufacturers guarantee 25-30 years, although many systems continue to work efficiently even after that.


What do you think about these recycling options? Have you heard of other people's experiences that make you skeptical?</div>

              <div>This is indeed frustrating and unfortunately not unusual. Laying modules crosswise can actually optimize the overall efficiency of a system, especially with more complex roof shapes. The fact that the municipality did not provide transparent reasons for its rejection is particularly problematic. Since the revision of the Spatial Planning Act (RPG) in 2022, the approval processes have actually been simplified - solar systems on roofs are now generally exempt from approval as long as certain basic criteria are met.

              <div>That is of course annoying, especially when it concerns the sunnier side. Every module not installed in the optimal position ultimately means lost yield. How satisfied are you with the performance of your system despite this limitation? It would also be interesting to know whether you have integrated a battery storage system in order to optimize the proportion of self-consumption - especially because the size of the system was limited by the municipality.

With a 9kWp system, a storage system could significantly increase the proportion of self-consumption, especially if there is little consumption in the house during the day. What is your current proportion of self-consumption and at what times of the day do you produce the most surplus?

              <div>I can understand that - the variety of providers does not make the selection easy. A reputable first port of call is the industry association Swissolar. There you will find certified solar installers in your region. They must meet strict quality standards.


A good installer should:

- Offer a free initial consultation on site

- Be able to demonstrate reference projects

- Transparently break down the costs

- Create multiple offers for comparison


Have you already had some initial experience with providers? What would be particularly important to you when working together?

            <div class="chat-message assistant">
              <div>This is actually an important decision. The question of storage depends largely on your consumption behavior. A storage unit makes particular sense if you use little electricity during the day and a lot in the evening - for example, if you work and mainly cook, wash or have other electricity-intensive activities in the evening.


Without storage, the system is significantly cheaper to purchase, but you then feed more electricity into the grid and receive compensation for it. With storage, you can increase your own consumption to around 60-80%, but you must expect additional costs of 8,000-12,000 francs.


What does your typical daily routine look like in terms of electricity consumption? That would help us to assess whether a storage system would be worthwhile for you.</div>

            <div class="chat-message assistant">
              <div>This actually makes the decision a little more complex. If your consumption pattern is irregular, an interesting alternative could be to start without a storage unit. The system can easily be expanded to include a storage unit later, once you know your actual consumption and feed-in patterns after about a year.


A modern option would also be an intelligent energy management system that automatically runs your appliances when the sun is shining - for example, washing machines or dishwashers. This increases self-consumption even without storage.


Have you had a look at your electricity consumption over the last few years? This data would be very helpful for dimensioning your system.</div>

              <div>5000 kilowatt hours (kWh) per year is a typical consumption for a Swiss household. With this consumption, a PV system with around 6-7 kWp output could make sense, which would require around 30-40 m² of roof area.


Without storage, you could cover around 30-35% of your electricity needs yourself. With storage, it would be 60-70%. The additional costs for the storage would pay for themselves in around 10-12 years based on your consumption.


A pragmatic strategy would be, as mentioned, to start with the PV system first and then add storage later when you know your consumption pattern better. What do you think about this step-by-step approach?</div>

              <div>That's a very realistic assessment! That's exactly why the step-by-step approach is often smart. You can initially benefit from the feed-in tariff when you are not at home. At the same time, there are a few clever ways to use more of your own solar power even without storage:


- Timers for appliances such as washing machines or dishwashers

- Smart home systems that control devices automatically

- Hot water preparation during the day


Have you already spoken to the installer about such automated solutions? These can be a cost-effective alternative to storage and can be easily integrated into everyday life.

              <div>These are two very important aspects! A solar system can actually combine both. On the environmental aspect: an average solar system on a single-family home in Switzerland saves about as much CO2 as two people cause by driving a car in a year.


As far as costs are concerned: thanks to falling prices for solar modules and government subsidies, a system usually pays for itself within 10-15 years. After that, you will be producing your own electricity practically for free.
